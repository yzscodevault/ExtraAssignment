# ExtraAssignment
C# Windows Form Application that has strong input validation, check out function 8 in this app
Even the name is called extra assignment. But this project is way beyongd or Extra than what was originally assigned.
I welcome you to challenge the function by going straight to function 8 and test out how good it can filter out the decimal, try to put decimal point at complicated positions with various combinations!
